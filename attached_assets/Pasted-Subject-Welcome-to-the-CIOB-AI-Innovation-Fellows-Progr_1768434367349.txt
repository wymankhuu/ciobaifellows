Subject: Welcome to the CIOB AI Innovation Fellows Program!

[Fellow Name],

Congratulations! We’re excited to welcome you into the CIOB AI Innovation Fellows Program. This year’s cohort brings together forward-thinking educators who will help shape how AI can be responsibly and powerfully leveraged across the CIOB.

We hope you’ve had a strong start to the school year and look forward to building a community of educators who will help shape how AI can be leveraged across the CIOB.

About the Program
The AI Innovation Fellows Program is a unique opportunity for CIOB educators and leaders to design and pilot real-world uses of AI that:
Enhance instruction and deepen student thinking
Address existing challenges in schools
Build next-generation practices rooted in responsible innovation
Contribute to our district-level priorities.

Program Commitment
Duration: 8-session learning series (90 minutes per session)
Format: Virtual and in-person sessions with targeted breakout groups
Support: Dedicated site visits to your school for personalized coaching
Independent Work: Fellows will complete some independent design and implementation work between the eight sessions (e.g. testing tools, documenting impact, iterating on classroom use).
Development Time: Direct collaboration with Playlab Learning Engineers for custom AI app creation
Showcase: Present your developed AI tools and impact at the AI Innovation Fellows Showcase in January
Professional Credit: 25 CTLE hours provided
Compensation: $2,000 at the end of the program for meeting all of the cohort objectives
Outcome: Contribute to a collection of proven AI applications and implementation models for district-wide scaling.

This is an intensive, hands-on program designed for educators ready to push boundaries and create concrete proof points for AI innovation in education within the CIOB and NYCPS. Our first session will be in-person on Tuesday, 9/30, from 4:30-6:00 PM (food will be served at 4:00 PM). Location will be announced next week.
